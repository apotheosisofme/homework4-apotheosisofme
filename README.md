# Homework 4

This is the starter code for Homework 4 in CIS 2348 in Fall 2019. Please read the instrutions in the homework assignment in Blackboard for details about the assignment.

This repository contains 4 files inside the src directory:

`Employee.java`, `DataAnalyst.java`, `SeniorDataAnalyst.java` and `SoftwareDeveloper.java`. You will need to interact with all four.

There is also an `*.iml` file which should make it easy to get your project started in IntelliJ. But you can also start a Java project from scratch
